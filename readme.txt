This is NOT meant to be a github readme, just an overview
of the project folder.

This project uses Python 3.7.3

We've included venv/ here, so that might make the setup easier.
Otherwise, you may delete it, and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
to get all of the necessary packages.

asset/ contains the images used for data.
asset/yalefaces.zip is the original archive, from http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database.

We've cropped the images for better performance, and
categorized them by individual.
